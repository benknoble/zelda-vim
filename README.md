# Adventure Awaits !

Here be dragons, evil wizard beasts, forests (bad and good), and dungeons
galore...

But fear not! A brave lone cursor, navigating them relentlessly, seeks to slay
bugs and save the princess! Can *you* reunite the Triforce?

![triforce screenshot][triforce]
Based on the color of the "Magical Golden Triangles" and the canonical colors
for Power, Wisdom and Courage, `triforce` uses a palette of yellow, with a dash
of red, green, blue thrown in. Now that I type that out, does anyone else wonder
if they picked those values because rgb is easy to render?

This is a set of [LoZ][loz]-inspired colorschemes for vim, named (so far)

- `ganon`
- `link`
- `triforce`
- `zelda`

More are planned for development; keep track of this repo by starring
it, [watching][watch] it, or [forking][fork] it.

For the moment, I will only be constructing dark themes as that's what I use. I
am open to (well-constructed) light themes, if well argued for.

I also only use terminal vim. I know that colorschemes are weird between
terminal and gvim, but I'm hoping this will be sufficient (or someone will port
them).
